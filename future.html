    <p> Global warming destroys habitats and kills the animals that inhabit it.</p>

    <p> The arctic was an icy palace until researchers reported the global warming crisis in 1938. Researchers then acknowledged that global warming has warmed the atmosphere by 3 degrees which put carbon dioxide levels at 420 which is an incredibly dangerous position that its never been in before.<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/"> nasa.com</a></p>

    <p> Wild life isn't the only animal in a deadly position right now, humans are also animals inhabiting the Earth and if the temperatures keep rising we will have no Earth to inhabit.</p>

    <p> In 1920 the atmospheric temperature was -0.27 degrees but now, last recorded in 2023 it raised to 1.17 degrees celsius due to a 50% carbon dioxide greenhouse gas crowding our planet's atmosphere which may not seem like alot but the degree increase was enough to melt ice caps by 137 metric tons a year releasing disease to our fish/food source killing the animals that ate the fish and rapidly continuing to permanently disrupt our food chain. With that disruption humanity has lost any chance to revert the damages done and will soon need to rely on lab grown alternatives within the next 200 years.</p>
    <p> If the planet is suffocating from greenhouse has emissions and is creating issues like ice cap melting, habitat burning, food recession, ect then one can only conjure the question of how long the organisms of the planet can survive which in science isn't very long.</p>
