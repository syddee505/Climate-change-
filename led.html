    <h1>What led to Global Warming?</h1>
    
    <p>Global warming is a major issue in the world currently, causing major changes</p>
    <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Carbon Dioxide</li>
      <p>Carbon Dioxide or CO2,gets released by the cutting of trees, burning of fossil fuels, and many other "natural processes".</p>
      <li>Methane</li>
      <p>Methane is also produced by natural processes, however it is also released by the natural processes of livestock, through their digestion and then release of manure. </p>
      <li>Nitrous Oxide</li>
      <p>Nitrous Oxide is released from the burning of vegetation.</p>
      <li>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
      <p>These are not made by natural means, and are only caused due to industrial activity.</p>       
    </ul>

    <h2>A major Cause?</h2>
    <p>A Main contributor to global warming is Human Activity.</p>

    <h6>Hotchkiss record, CC0</h6>
    <p>Industrial activities have increased the "atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 1750." Things such, factories and vehicles have increased the global C02 Emissions. We already exhale amount of carbon when breathing, however it isn't enough to cause detrimental issues.</p>

    <p>But because humans would do things such as use large amounts of livestock to produce manure, releasing large amounts of methane, or the increase and very common usage of Cars and CO2 emitting vehicles has led us to the point where global warming has become very serious.</p>
