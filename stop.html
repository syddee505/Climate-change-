        <h1> How to stop Global Warming</h1>
        <img src="stop.jpeg" alt="stop">
        <h2> Speak Up!</h2>
        <p> Encourage your friends and family to speak out upon global warming so the government can see the problem it is causing and be pressured to act. 
          It is stated in <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-you-can-stop-global-warming">¨NRDC¨</a>, “The main reason elected officials do anything difficult is because their constituents make them,” Haq says.</p>
        <h2>Power your home with renewable energy</h2>
        <p> Save energy at home. Much of our electricity and heat are powered by coal, oil and gas. Look into organizations that utilize renewable sources. It is said in <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-you-can-stop-global-warming">¨NRDC¨</a>,“Building heating and cooling are among the biggest uses of energy,” Haq says. Indeed, heating and air-conditioning account for almost half of home energy use.¨ </p>
        <h2> Transportation </h2> 
        <p> Flying is one of the major sources of pollution. Although cars are also used by almost the whole world, it is recommended to have a stroll on your bicycle or just walking in public in the open air. It is also stated in <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-you-can-stop-global-warming">¨NRDC¨</a>, ¨Choosing to live in walkable smart-growth cities and towns with quality public transportation leads to less driving, less money spent on fuel, and less pollution in the air.¨</p>
        <h2> Nature and Vegetation</h2>
        <p> We need to restore nature as it is essential in absorbing carbon as it states in <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-carbon-cycle#:~:text=Plants%20constantly%20exchange%20carbon%20with,carbon%20dioxide%20when%20they%20decay.">DOE</a>,¨Plants constantly exchange carbon with the atmosphere. Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and much of this carbon dioxide is then stored in roots, permafrost, grasslands, and forests.¨ The conservation of nature is essential in fighting against climate change. It is stated in <a href=¨https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/climate-change/solutions-climate-change/¨> GREENPEACE</a>,¨One of the best ways for individuals to help stop climate change is by reducing their meat and dairy consumption, or by going fully vegan.¨</p>
